el6-owncloud
============

The ownCloud docker image on top of CentOS 6.

Pull
----

    docker pull dockingbay/centos-owncloud:latest .

Usually you'll want to pull some specific tag instead of `latest`. See
[available centos-owncloud tags](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dockingbay/centos-owncloud/tags/manage/).

Run
---

* Prepare a place for ownCloud volumes on the host machine.

    mkdir -p /var/lib/owncloud/{config,data,mysql}

* Label the directories to make SELinux happy.

    chcon -R system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0 /var/lib/owncloud/data
    chcon -R system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0 /var/lib/owncloud/config
    chcon -R system_u:object_r:docker_var_lib_t:s0     /var/lib/owncloud/mysql

* Run ownCloud docker container.

    docker run -p 8000:80 \
        -v /var/lib/owncloud/config:/var/www/html/owncloud/config
        -v /var/lib/owncloud/data:/var/www/html/owncloud/data
        -v /var/lib/owncloud/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
        dockingbay/centos-owncloud:latest

  This will bind ownCloud to port 8000. This is ok for testing, but
  for real use you'll want to put a reverse proxy in front of it and
  make it accessible only through HTTPS.

* Point your browser to host (and port) where you're running
  ownCloud. If you're just testing it on your workstation and
  following these steps, the URL is `http://localhost:8000`.

* To increase security for real use, the ownCloud installation wizard
  will not be used (someone else could use the wizard before you
  would). Instead, ownCloud will autoinstall itself. The DB and admin
  passwords will be autogenerated, and you will find them in
  `/var/lib/owncloud/config/initrc`. Move that file out of that
  directory and put it somewhere safe.

* Log into ownCloud with the admin password from previous step. You
  can now change the admin password to something else. You're running
  ownCloud now, congrats!

Notes
-----

Because the `apps` directory contains apps both from the ownCloud RPM
and apps that can be downloaded after installation, there's not really
a straightforward and secure solution to allow and persistence of the
downloaded apps and updating the apps that come with the RPM (= apps
that come with the ownCloud docker image). Currently the `apps`
directory is not exported as a volume, which means that all changes
there are lost between updates of the docker image.
